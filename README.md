A couple of tools that might be useful for certain artists:

### akimbo

Poll Akimbo to find calls for artwork, calls for submissions, etc.
Calls are ordered by deadline â€“ when everything works.
More details in [doc/akimbo.md](doc/akimbo.md).

### collate

Calculates the collation sequence for a book
and shows it on the screen,
so that you can do manual collation.
If you specify the number of preliminary pages
the script will use roman numerals for prelim pages
so you can check your work.

Requires [Text::Roman](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Roman).

### yalify

Converts [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping) spellings,
which is more well-known in Hong Kong,
into [Yale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Cantonese) spellings,
which I believe is probably still more well-known in North America.
I needed this for a project because I was not (and still am not) familiar with the Yale system
and Yale spellings for Cantonese are difficult to type even on Linux.
